== Installation ==

The plugin assumes you're already using Contact Form 7, if not install it first before you proceed. 

1. Install the plugin from the Plugins menu and then activate it.
2. When using Contact Form 7, you will now see the toggle switch below the form edit textarea's.

Its probably a good idea to switch back to raw code before saving things like javascript or any other code: TinyMCE may also remove certain elements from you html. 

= Manual Instructions =

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
